## 🗂 My Cybersecurity / IAM Portfolio

Each project below is a fully documented, real-world simulation of how identity & access governance works inside an enterprise.

### 📌 Completed Projects

| Project | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Project 1 — Startup Simulation** | Designed a complete fictional enterprise (FitVault): org chart, departments, job roles, responsibilities, and tool usage. Foundation for all IAM governance. | ✅ Completed |
| **Project 2 — Tool Inventory & RBAC** | Detailed inventory of 15+ enterprise tools, mapped authentication methods (SAML/SCIM/OAuth), and built least-privilege RBAC models. | ✅ Completed |
| **Project 3 — Access Groups & Automated Provisioning** | Built birthright access, department-based groups, dynamic rules, and Workday → Okta → app provisioning logic. | ✅ Completed |
| **Project 4 — JIT Access (Just-In-Time)** | Created JIT elevation workflows, expiry policies, auto-revocation, and approval structures across high-risk tools. | ✅ Completed |
| **Project 5 — User Access Review (UAR)** | End-to-end quarterly UAR process: reviewer workflows, high-risk privilege identification, downgrade recommendations. | ✅ Completed |
| **Project 6 — Zapier Automation** | Automated manager reminders for pending UAR approvals using Google Sheets triggers and Gmail API. | ✅ Completed |
| **Project 7 — Deprovisioning** | Mapped deprovisioning for SCIM and non-SCIM tools; identified risks, controls, and created automated removal flows. | ✅ Completed |
| **Project 8 — Azure AD / Entra ID IAM Project** | Implemented PIM JIT roles, configured Azure role activation rules, access reviews, and identity governance policies. | ✅ Completed |
